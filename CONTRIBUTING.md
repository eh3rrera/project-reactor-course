# Contributing
Any contributions like typo corrections, added review questions, added explanations, translations, etc. are greatly appreciated.

However, if you choose to contribute something more than typo corrections, in addition to the terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license, you agree to give me a non-exclusive license to use that content for the book as I deem appropriate.

# Translations
We may be accustomed to using English every day, but language can be a real problem for some people.

You can help everyone a lot by translating the book into your own language. However, I don't think it would be fair for me or someone else to make money off your effort, so every translation must be licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license to make it free for everybody.

If you agree with that, here are some guidelines:
- Use the English version as a source for your translation.
- Open a new issue indicating the language and the chapters you wish to translate.
- Create a directory in the root of the project for your language (if there's none yet), and put your translation there.
- Try to remain as close to the original text as possible, but also, feel free to adapt the text so it feels natural in your language.
- If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.
