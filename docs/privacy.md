Last updated: 04/26/2023

Esteban Herrera ("the author", we", "us", or "our") operates this website (the "Service").

This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our Service.

By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

Currently, we do not collect any personal information directly from users of our Service. However, if we decide to add third-party tools or services, such as analytics tools or social media plugins, they may collect user information on our behalf. In such cases, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly and notify you of the changes.

## 2. Third-Party Services

If we integrate third-party tools or services into our Service, these third parties may have access to your personal information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use your information for any other purpose.

These third-party tools or services will be governed by their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services that we may integrate into our Service in the future.

## 3. Security

The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
