# Working with Mono and Flux
* * *
In this module, we're going to review:
- The interfaces described in the Reactive Streams specification
- `Mono` and `Flux`, the implementations of the `Publisher` interface from the Reactive Streams specification
- How to create `Mono` and `Flux` objects
- Subscription methods

You can find the code for this module [here](https://github.com/eh3rrera/project-reactor-course/tree/main/02).
